# Maternal Care & Pregnancy Tracker App

A **Progressive Web App (PWA)** for expectant mothers — a private, offline-capable pregnancy companion with medically grounded weekly guidance, daily wellness tracking, and emotional support. Built as a portfolio HealthTech project with a warm, empathetic B2C tone.

> **Note:** All user-facing copy is in Russian. Source code identifiers, comments, and documentation are in English for portfolio and open-source clarity.

## Overview

This is a **100% client-side** pregnancy companion — no backend, no accounts, no user data leaving the device. Everything persists in the browser's **LocalStorage**, making it private, offline-capable, and installable as a home-screen PWA on iOS and Android.

The app supports **optional personalization**: the user can enter their name and a close contact (partner, parent, friend) for greetings and support messages. Medical content is informational and aligned with WHO / ACOG guidance.

## Run Locally

No build step, Node.js, or package manager required.

### Option 1 — Open directly

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox).

> Some browsers restrict LocalStorage for `file://` URLs. If data does not persist, use Option 2.

### Option 2 — Local HTTP server (recommended)

**Python 3:**

```bash
cd path/to/project
python -m http.server 8080
```

**Node.js (npx):**

```bash
npx serve .
```

Then visit **http://localhost:8080** (or the port shown).

### Option 3 — VS Code / Cursor Live Server

Install the **Live Server** extension, right-click `index.html` → **Open with Live Server**.

---

## First Launch

1. Optionally enter your **name** and **expected due date (EDD)** on the setup screen.
2. In **Settings**, set baby gender for themed colors (girl / boy / neutral) and add an emergency contact.
3. Explore tabs: **Home**, **Care Plan**, **Journal**, **Hospital Bag**, **Settings**.

All data stays on the device. Use **Settings → Clear all data** to reset (app-scoped keys only).
